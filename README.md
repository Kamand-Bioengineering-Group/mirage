XPECTO Epidemic 2.0 is an advanced epidemic simulation and competition platform designed to help students, researchers, and policymakers understand the dynamics of disease spread and the impact of various intervention strategies.

## üåü Features

- **Realistic Epidemic Simulation**: Powered by an enhanced simulation engine that models disease spread, variants, and population dynamics
- **Strategic Interventions**: Implement healthcare allocation, economic policies, lockdowns, and research investments
- **Competition Framework**: Test your strategies against others in various scenarios with different difficulty levels
- **Robust Evaluation**: Comprehensive strategy evaluation with detailed metrics and visualizations
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for practice and competition submissions

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dev-on-go/XPECTO-Epidemic-2.0.git
cd XPECTO-Epidemic-2.0
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Explore the Documentation**: Start by reading the [Introduction](Documentation/01_Introduction.md) and [How To Play](Documentation/02_How_To_Play.md) guides.

2. **Practice Mode**: Open the [Practice Playground](notebooks/practice_playground.ipynb) notebook to experiment with different strategies without affecting your official scores.

3. **Competition Mode**: When you're ready, use the [Competition Evaluation](notebooks/competition_evaluation.ipynb) notebook to submit your official attempts.
