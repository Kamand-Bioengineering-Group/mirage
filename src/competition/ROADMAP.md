## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1 Backend Developer (Flask/Python)
- 1 Frontend Developer (React/Vue/Angular)
- 1 Firebase/Cloud Specialist
- 1 UI/UX Designer (part-time)
- 1 QA Engineer (part-time)

### Infrastructure
- Firebase Blaze Plan (pay-as-you-go)
- Cloud hosting for Flask backend
- Cloud storage for simulation data
- CDN for frontend hosting
- Domain name and SSL certificate

## Cost Estimates

### One-time Costs
- Development: ~400 hours @ $50-100/hr = $20,000-40,000
- Design: ~80 hours @ $40-80/hr = $3,200-6,400
- Setup and configuration: ~40 hours @ $60-100/hr = $2,400-4,000

### Ongoing Monthly Costs
- Firebase: $50-200/month (depends on usage)
- Cloud hosting: $50-150/month
- Storage: $20-100/month
- CDN: $10-50/month
- Monitoring tools: $20-100/month

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Firebase costs exceed estimates | High | Medium | Implement usage quotas, optimize queries, cache frequently accessed data |
| Simulation performance issues | High | Medium | Implement job queue, horizontally scale workers, optimize simulation code |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular security audits, use Firebase Authentication, implement proper RBAC |
| User adoption challenges | Medium | Medium | Create intuitive UI, provide documentation, offer support channels |
| Data migration issues | Medium | Low | Create comprehensive test suite, validate all data migrations, backup before changes |

## Success Metrics

- User registration and retention rates
- Number of simulations run
- Average time to complete competition
- User satisfaction scores (via feedback)
- System performance metrics (response time, uptime)
- Cost per user/simulation

## Maintenance Plan

- Weekly code deployments
- Monthly security updates
- Quarterly feature releases
- Ongoing user feedback collection
- Regular performance optimization
