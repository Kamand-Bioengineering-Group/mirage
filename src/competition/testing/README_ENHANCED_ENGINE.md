# Enhanced Epidemic Simulation Engine

## Overview

The EnhancedEngine is an improved simulation engine for the XPECTO competition platform that ensures different intervention strategies produce significantly different outcomes. It builds upon the existing MockEngine while adding more realistic modeling of epidemic dynamics and intervention effects.

## Key Features

1. **Network-based disease spread modeling**
   - SIR model with contact networks
   - Stochastic infection spread with variability
   - Region-specific transmission dynamics

2. **Intervention fatigue and compliance modeling**
   - Lockdown compliance decays over time
   - More severe lockdowns cause faster compliance decay
   - Diminishing returns for repeated interventions

3. **Regional and demographic heterogeneity**
   - Urban vs. rural population dynamics
   - Different responses to interventions by region
   - Region-specific economic impacts

4. **Economic sector-specific impacts**
   - Essential services
   - In-person services
   - Remote-capable businesses
   - Different sectors respond differently to interventions

5. **Synergistic and antagonistic intervention effects**
   - Complementary interventions amplify effects
   - Contradictory interventions reduce effectiveness
   - Dynamic scoring based on strategy coherence

6. **Healthcare system modeling**
   - Healthcare capacity thresholds
   - System overwhelm effects on mortality
   - Research breakthrough benefits

## Integration with Competition Platform

The EnhancedEngine is designed as a drop-in replacement for the MockEngine:

```python
from src.competition import CompetitionManager
from src.competition.testing.enhanced_engine import EnhancedEngine

# Create an enhanced engine instance
engine = EnhancedEngine(seed=42)  # Optional seed for reproducibility

# Create CompetitionManager with enhanced engine
competition = CompetitionManager(data_dir="practice_data", engine=engine)

# Rest of your code remains unchanged
```

## Differences from MockEngine

The EnhancedEngine maintains the same API as MockEngine but produces more varied and realistic outcomes:

1. **Strategy Differentiation**: Different strategies produce significantly different outcomes, allowing for meaningful comparison of approaches.

2. **Realistic Disease Dynamics**: More sophisticated modeling of how diseases spread through populations with region-specific dynamics.

3. **Behavioral Effects**: Models human behavior like lockdown fatigue and compliance decay over time.

4. **Economic Complexity**: Models sector-specific economic impacts rather than treating the economy as a single entity.

5. **Dynamic Scoring**: Strategy-aware scoring that reflects real-world tradeoffs in epidemic management.

## Implementation Details

### Key Parameters

The EnhancedEngine exposes several configurable parameters:

- **Disease parameters**: R0 base and variance, mortality rates, recovery periods, etc.
- **Intervention effects**: Lockdown effectiveness, economic support efficiency, etc.
- **Regional parameters**: Population distribution, density factors, economic weights
- **Economic sectors**: GDP weights and lockdown impacts by sector

### Enhanced State Tracking

The engine maintains enhanced state information:

- Intervention history for modeling fatigue
- Regional infection rates
- Sector-specific economic health
- Healthcare capacity tracking
- Research progress with breakthrough effects

## Running Tests

To test the EnhancedEngine against the original MockEngine, run:

```
python run_engine_tests.py
```

This executes a suite of tests to compare outcomes between engines and verify that different strategies produce different results.

## Research Foundation

The enhanced engine incorporates insights from academic research on epidemic modeling, including:

1. **Network-based SIR models**: Realistic modeling of disease spread through social networks
2. **Behavioral epidemiology**: How human behavior affects disease spread
3. **Economic impact studies**: Sector-specific impacts of pandemic restrictions
4. **Public health research**: Effectiveness of different intervention strategies
5. **Healthcare capacity modeling**: Effects of system overwhelm on mortality rates
