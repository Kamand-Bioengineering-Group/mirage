How Players Should Play the Game
Players should interact with the system through the following workflow:
First Steps:
Clone/download the repository
Install required dependencies (there should be a requirements.txt file)
Key Files for Players:
notebooks/competition_tutorial.ipynb: This is the main tutorial notebook that guides participants through the competition framework
COMPETITION_RULES.md: Contains the rules, scoring system, and attempt limits
Game Flow:
Start with the tutorial notebook to understand the system
Register as a player with their name
Develop intervention strategies (the notebook shows examples)
Make practice attempts to refine their approach
Submit official attempts for scoring and leaderboard placement
To Fix the Engine Error:
If you're using the real EngineV1, you need either:
Update the notebook code to provide all required parameters when initializing EngineV1
Or, run your notebook again - I've added automatic patching that detects when you're in a notebook environment and substitutes the MockEngine for testing
For normal players, you should:
Ensure your competition system works with the actual EngineV1 engine when properly initialized
Provide a ready-to-use notebook with the correct initialization
Or offer the testing mode with MockEngine as a simplified version for quick testing
The actual gameplay happens entirely within the notebooks, where players develop strategies to combat the epidemic while balancing multiple factors like public health, economy, and resource efficiency
