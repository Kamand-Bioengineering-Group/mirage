# Available Scenarios

This document describes the different scenarios available in the XPECTO Epidemic 2.0 competition. Each scenario presents unique challenges with different parameters, requiring adapted strategies.

## Core Scenarios

### Standard Scenario

The Standard scenario represents a baseline epidemic challenge with moderate difficulty.

**Key Parameters:**
- **R0**: 2.5 (Basic reproduction number)
- **Initial Infections**: Primarily in the capital region
- **Initial Resources**: 1000 units
- **Population**: 10,000 individuals
- **Healthcare Capacity**: Moderate
- **Economic Resilience**: Moderate

**Strategy Considerations:**
- This scenario is balanced, requiring attention to both health and economic outcomes
- It serves as the baseline for developing and testing initial strategies
- Success requires a balanced approach to containment and economic support

### Challenging Scenario

The Challenging scenario presents a more difficult epidemic situation with a more contagious disease and multiple initial outbreak locations.

**Key Parameters:**
- **R0**: 3.5 (Higher than Standard)
- **Initial Infections**: Multiple regions (capital and other major cities)
- **Initial Resources**: 800 units (fewer than Standard)
- **Population**: 10,000 individuals
- **Healthcare Capacity**: Limited
- **Economic Resilience**: Low

**Strategy Considerations:**
- This scenario tests your ability to handle multiple simultaneous outbreaks
- Resources are more constrained, requiring careful prioritization
- The higher R0 means the disease spreads more quickly
- Economic impacts are more severe, requiring earlier economic support

## Specialized Scenarios

### Expert Challenge

The Expert scenario presents an extremely difficult situation with a highly contagious disease and limited resources.

**Key Parameters:**
- **R0**: 4.0 (Very high)
- **Initial Infections**: Multiple regions with high initial case counts
- **Initial Resources**: 600 units (severely limited)
- **Disease Mortality**: 0.04 (higher than standard)
- **Healthcare Capacity**: Very limited

**Strategy Considerations:**
- This is the most challenging scenario, requiring exceptional strategy
- Resource allocation is critical due to severe constraints
- Early containment is essential due to high R0
- Success may require sacrificing some objectives to excel in others

### Balanced Challenge

This scenario focuses on testing your ability to balance health and economic outcomes.

**Key Parameters:**
- **R0**: 3.0 (Moderately high)
- **Initial Infections**: Concentrated in main population centers
- **Initial Resources**: 800 units
- **Economic Impact Factor**: 1.3 (higher economic sensitivity)

**Strategy Considerations:**
- This scenario specifically tests your ability to balance competing priorities
- Economic impacts are more sensitive to interventions
- Finding the optimal lockdown levels is critical

### Economic Crisis

This scenario focuses on preserving economic stability during an epidemic.

**Key Parameters:**
- **R0**: 2.8 (Moderate)
- **Initial Infections**: Concentrated in financial centers
- **Initial Resources**: 850 units
- **Economic Impact Factor**: 2.0 (extremely high economic sensitivity)
- **Global Trade Impact**: 0.7 (international economic effects)

**Strategy Considerations:**
- Economic preservation is particularly challenging
- The disease targets economically important regions
- International factors amplify economic impacts
- Success requires finding ways to contain the disease while minimizing economic disruption

### Resource Scarcity

This scenario tests your efficiency in using limited resources.

**Key Parameters:**
- **R0**: 3.2 (Moderately high)
- **Initial Infections**: Moderate initial spread
- **Initial Resources**: 400 units (extremely limited)
- **Resource Replenishment Rate**: 0.5 (slow recovery of resources)

**Strategy Considerations:**
- Resource efficiency is the primary challenge
- You must achieve results with minimal resource expenditure
- Prioritization is critical as you cannot address all needs
- Timing of interventions is crucial to maximize impact per resource spent

## Approaching Different Scenarios

When facing a new scenario:

1. **Analyze the Parameters**: Understand what makes this scenario unique
2. **Identify Key Challenges**: Determine which factors will be most difficult to manage
3. **Adapt Your Strategy**: Modify your approach to address the specific challenges
4. **Focus on Strengths**: In difficult scenarios, it may be better to excel in some areas rather than attempting to balance all factors
5. **Test in Practice Mode**: Always test your approach in practice mode before making official attempts

## Playing Multiple Scenarios

For the official competition:
- You must complete at least the Standard and Challenging scenarios
- Specialized scenarios are optional but can improve your overall ranking
- Your final score will be based on your best attempt on each required scenario
- For advanced players, attempting all scenarios provides a more comprehensive evaluation

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the different scenarios:
- Begin with the Standard scenario to develop your basic strategy
- Progress to more difficult scenarios as you refine your approach
- Review the [Competition Rules](04_Competition_Rules.md) to understand how your performance is scored
- Try the [Practice Playground](../notebooks/practice_playground.ipynb) to experiment with different strategies
