# XPECTO Epidemic 2.0: Introduction

## What is XPECTO Epidemic 2.0?

XPECTO Epidemic 2.0 is a sophisticated epidemic management simulation that challenges players to develop effective strategies for controlling a simulated disease outbreak. As a player, you'll make critical decisions about resource allocation, containment measures, and economic policies that will determine the ultimate outcome of the epidemic.

The simulation models the complex interactions between:
- Disease spread dynamics
- Population health outcomes
- Economic impacts
- Resource constraints
- Healthcare system capacity

## Key Features

- **Realistic Epidemic Modeling**: The simulation uses a modified SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model with parameters that can be influenced through your interventions.

- **Multi-Factor Decision Making**: Every decision involves trade-offs between public health, economic prosperity, and resource efficiency.

- **Standardized Competition Scenarios**: Challenge yourself and compete against others on carefully designed scenarios with fixed parameters.

- **Detailed Analytics**: Track your performance across multiple metrics and visualize the impacts of your decisions.

- **Strategy Development**: Design and test different approaches in practice mode before making official competition attempts.

## The Challenge

Your goal is to achieve the highest possible score by:

1. **Minimizing Deaths**: Protect as much of the population as possible
2. **Preserving Economic Activity**: Maintain GDP while implementing necessary controls
3. **Controlling Infection**: Keep the peak infection rate as low as possible
4. **Using Resources Efficiently**: Allocate limited resources effectively
5. **Containing Quickly**: End the epidemic in the shortest possible time

The most successful strategies will find creative ways to balance these competing objectives.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey as an epidemic manager:

1. Start with the [02_How_To_Play.md](02_How_To_Play.md) guide to understand the basic mechanics
2. Explore [03_Intervention_Strategies.md](03_Intervention_Strategies.md) to learn how to develop interventions
3. Practice in the Practice Playground notebook before entering competition mode
4. Read the [04_Competition_Rules.md](04_Competition_Rules.md) to understand scoring and submission

Good luck! The health and prosperity of your simulated population depend on your decisions.
